Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<p>The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can't cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versaâ€”your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come.</p>\n<h3>Animist Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new techniques and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Animist Spells Per Day.</p>\n<p>You are a prepared spellcaster for the purposes of determining how you interact with staves and other items or effects that differentiate between prepared and spontaneous spellcasters.</p>\n<h3>Apparition Spellcasting</h3>\n<p>You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Vessel Spells</h3>\n<p>Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can't cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained it (for example, an animist who has cast earth's bile during their turn can't then cast or Sustain another instance of earth's bile during that same turn).</p>\n<p>It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or tell a story.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, though certain feats or abilities adjust this number, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Animists have a gift for divine magic that allows them to serve as conduits or bridges for otherworldly spiritual entities known collectively as apparitions; through them, these entities can commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. Apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations that have grown thought and purpose over time, or they may be a different variation altogether.</p>\n<p>Some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming deep partnerships over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist's journey takes them. Each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitions from the list on page 17 to attune to. Of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. Your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of Lore skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique avatar form.</p>\n<p>When you Refocus, you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. All your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. If an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its giftsâ€”you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you can't use its vessel spell or avatar formâ€”until you attune to it again. When you disperse your primary apparition, one of your remaining apparitions becomes your primary apparition, chosen by you at the time of dispersal.</p>"

If you or an ally within 30 feet takes piercing or slashing damage from a foe's critical hit or takes persistent bleed damage, Drinking from the Chalice before the end of your next turn grants that injured creature greater restoration to make up for its lost vitality. On a sip, the temporary Hit Points granted to the creature increase to 2 + your Charisma modifier + your level.

Add an additional half your level to the temporary HP if the drinker sips, or add your level to the HP regained if the drinker drains the chalice. This effect isn't cumulative if you hit with more than one Strike.</p>\n<h3><strong>Paragon Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>When you or an ally drain the chalice, the overwhelming vitality it's collected helps you overcome many ailments.

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35â€“39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p>\n<h2>Skill</h2>\n<p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p>\n<h2>Anathema</h2>\n<p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the tableâ€”you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p>\n<h2>Sanctification</h2>\n<p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"

Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar.</p>\n<h3>Expanding <strong>Immanence</strong> And Transcendence</h3>\n<p>Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait.</p>\n<h2>Ikons</h2>\n<p>As an exemplar, you select three ikons at first level. Typically, you will want to ensure at least one of your ikons is a weapon. Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can't be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-magical, level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.</p>\n<p>Your ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.</p>\n<p>If you acquire a new item the ikon's usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing magic item, like a cloak of illusions or a searing blade, into your ikon. If the item wasn't already a divine item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the arcane, occult, primal, or magical trait from the item and adding the divine trait. Artifacts, intelligent items, and other similarly powerful objects might resist your attempts to exert your divinity over them, with unpredictable results determined by the GM.</p>"

Choose an implement from the options presented below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PoclGJ7BCEyIuqJe]{Amulet}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.DK1LCE5pd0YCY11c]{Bell}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.1vgFGSnn0DIBmK7j]{Chalice}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.AltwHU7hCqTwpn48]{Lantern}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.N6KvTbaRsphc0Ymb]{Mirror}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.DhdLzrcMvB93Rjmt]{Regalia}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.MyN1cQgE0HsLF20e]{Tome}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.pDxdE8S8QJV2PGiB]{Wand}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.YiDkrwaxiF7Gao7y]{Weapon}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p>\n<p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.</p>\n<h3><strong>Exploit Vulnerability</strong></h3>\n<p>You know that every creature, no matter how obscure, has a weakness. By identifying and empowering the right object, you can strike down even the most resilient of monsters. You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p>\n<p>You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortal Weakness</strong> After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Antithesis</strong> You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon Strikes equal to 2 + half your level.</li>\n</ul>"

    "Impulses": {
      "name": "Impulses",
      "description": "<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>"

      "description": "<p>As a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.</p>\n<p>When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements - air, earth, fire metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>"

Lantern implements are associated with the harrow suit of stars and the astrological signs of the lantern bearer and the archer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Initiate Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>While you hold your lantern, its burning light leaves secrets no place to hide. You can light or extinguish your lantern as a free action once each turn with nothing but a thought, which has the concentrate trait. The lantern shines bright light out to 20 feet and dim light out 20 feet further; this has the evocation, light, and magical traits (the counteract rank against magical darkness is equal to half your level rounded up).</p>\n<p>The lantern's magical light attempts to reveal the unseen. You and your allies in the lantern's area of bright light gain a +1 status bonus to visual Perception checks to notice anything that is also within the bright light, and a +1 status bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge against creatures within the bright light, as the light exposes their true natures. During exploration, even if you aren't Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find traps, environmental hazards, haunts, and secrets (such as secret doors). The GM rolls each time a given hazard or secret comes within 20 feet of you and within the lantern's bright light. These effects have the divination, magical, and revelation traits.</p>\n<h3><strong>Adept Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the initiate benefits, when you hold your lantern, its light reveals the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} and the ethereal. The bright light increases to 30 feet, with dim light out 30 feet further. While you're holding your lantern, invisible and ethereal creatures within the bright light become visible as rippling distortions, though they're still @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}. This doesn't give you any special ability to affect a creature on the Ethereal Plane, but it ensures you're aware of the creatures' presence.</p>\n<h3><strong>Intensify Vulnerability</strong></h3>\n<p>Your lantern's light flares and burns bright, leaving no shadows in which secrets and enemies can hide. Against the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, the status bonuses from the lantern's initiate benefit increase to +2. The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks and Stealth checks as long as it's within the lantern's light. The creature can't be @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} while it's in the lantern's light, though it still can potentially become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} or undetected using cover or means other than the concealed condition.</p>\n<h3><strong>Paragon Benefit</strong></h3>\n<p>In addition to the other benefits, your lantern reveals all things as they truly are. The bright light increases to 40 feet, with dim light out 40 feet further. While you're holding your lantern, the GM rolls a secret counteract check against any illusion or transmutation that comes within the lantern's bright light, but only for the purpose of determining whether you and others can see through it (for instance, if the check succeeds against a polymorph spell, you can see the creature's true form, but you don't end the spell). Use half your level rounded up as the counteract rank and your class DC - 10 as the counteract modifier. On a failed counteract check, the lantern can't attempt to counteract that illusion or polymorph effect again until midnight. You can choose to leave any illusion or transmutation you discover intact, instead of counteracting it.</p>"

      "name": "Sorcerer Spellcasting",
      "description": "<p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"

Deviations, unfortunately, lack these safeguards, their powers coming from haphazard circumstance and interactions rather than intentional design. A character using their deviation always risks the chance of backlash.</p>\n<p>Whenever you attempt to use a deviation, roll a @Check[flat|dc:5]. On a success, you use your deviation and the DC for subsequent checks increases by 5, to a maximum of 20 (@Check[flat|dc:10] @Check[flat|dc:15] @Check[flat|dc:20]); on a failure, you use your deviation and then suffer a backlash effect, after which your flat check DC resets to 5. Backlash progresses from mild, to moderate, to severe. When you have already taken mild backlash in a given day, the next time you would take backlash, you take the moderate backlash instead, and if you have already taken moderate backlash, you take the severe backlash instead, and your deviation can't be used for the rest of the dayâ€”attempting to use it simply brings pain. When you make your daily preparations, your flat check DC returns to 5 and your next backlash returns to mild.</p>\n<p>Any effects from backlash can't be reduced, prevented, or otherwise bypassed. Conditions and damage you take from backlash can't be reduced or prevented by resistance or immunity, but still triggers any weakness you have to it.</p>\n<h2>Wraith Deviant Feats</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jPWF8Xe0UqVvbeyv]{Eerie Flicker}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.C3ukUk4Js10o5IBA]{Ghostly Grasp (Deviant)}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.VAxtUenSWEBWYBRt]{Enervating Wail}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.YFPmD8BHv0XaF55G]{Distant Wandering}</p>\n<h3>Universal Deviant Feats</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.mXp6G4YWCXGvp7Qd]{Awakened Power}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Km6YO7Ky2bEwhAFD]{Greater Awakened Power}</p>"
