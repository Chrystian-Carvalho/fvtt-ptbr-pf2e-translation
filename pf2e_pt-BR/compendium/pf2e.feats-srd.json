Add all the spells in your repertoire to this book for free. You can use the Occultism skill to Learn Spells (page 238) and add them to your spellbook by paying the appropriate cost, similar to a wizard. During your daily preparations, choose any one spell from your book of occult spells. If that spell is already in your spell repertoire, you can treat it as an additional signature spell that day. If it isn’t in your repertoire, treat it as though it were until your next daily preparations.</p>"

			"description": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DetailedOutput\"><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Charisma 14, second mark member of the Firebrands<br></span></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Your Firebrand training has taught you that achieving something is more satisfying if you boast about it first. You declare a boast about a particular skill action, such as <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=28\">Balance</a>, <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=53\">Demoralize</a>, or <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26\">Recall Knowledge</a>. The first time you attempt this action within the next minute in a context the GM deems both suitably challenging and meaningful, you must roll twice and use the lower result. If you succeed at this check, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to attempt the same action for 10 minutes. If you fail this check or don’t attempt the action within 1 minute, you instead take a –1 circumstance penalty on checks to attempt the same action for 1 hour.<br><br>If the chosen action can be used with multiple skills, such as <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=24\">Identify Magic</a> or Recall Knowledge, you must specify which skill you are using for that particular action, such as using <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=2\">Arcana</a> to Identify Magic, and your bonus or penalty after the boast applies only to checks using that skill for that action. Once you declare a boast about a particular action, you cannot declare a boast about the same action until the next time you make daily preparations, regardless of whether you succeed or fail at the check.<br><br>Typically a challenging task is one with at least a standard DC for your level, though the difficulty may be higher depending on the situation. A meaningful context is one where the action’s success or failure is relevant to the pursuit of your goals, rather than a boast you made simply to gain a bonus later.<br><br><strong>Special</strong> You can’t select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Firebrand Braggart archetype.&nbsp;</p>"
